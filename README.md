# Shots and Beer
A simple mobile game made for the TDL School Course!

The user can go and start a game, where he has to guess 4-5-6 numbers, based on the chosen difficulty, and he can see his previous input results - if a number is correctly guessed in the correct place, it shows up as green, if it is guessed but not in the correct place - yellow, otherwise it is grey.

After winning the game, his score is saved (attempts made and time), which he can go on to view in the High Scores menu. Lost/unfinished games are not counted.
